A challenging but rewarding day as we tackled our first major mountain pass. We started early to avoid the heat of the day, though at higher elevations the temperature was quite comfortable.

Today we were joined by Dr. Maria Schneider, a glaciologist from ETH ZÃ¼rich, who rode with us for part of the day and gave an impromptu lecture during our lunch break about the scientific methods used to measure glacier retreat.

**Key facts we learned today:**

* The Alps have lost approximately 50% of their glacier volume since 1900
* The rate of loss has accelerated dramatically in the past 20 years
* If current trends continue, most smaller Alpine glaciers will completely disappear by 2050

We experienced two flat tires today on the rough mountain roads, but our support team had us back on the road quickly each time.

The views from the top of the pass were absolutely breathtaking, a reminder of exactly what we're fighting to preserve.
