    "p2": "However, glaciers are shrinking at an alarming rate due to climate change. Less snow is falling and higher temperatures are melting more ice each year than is being added. In the Alps, this is clearly visible: many small glaciers have already disappeared.",

    "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "question1":"What is the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer1": "The Glorious Glacier Ride is an individual cycling adventure along the most beautiful but retreating glaciers of the Alps to raise awareness on climate disruption. The total ride is 1,500km and more than 30,000 meters of elevation gain need to be climbed. Participants fundraise carbon removal: they invite friends, family, etc to start removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere via their individual fundraising campaign.",
    "question2":"How can I support?",
    "answer2": "You can make a donation to the rider of your choice. You can choose a postcard that will be sent to you, or a direct donation. The money is used to fund carbon removal projects.",
    "question3":"What is Carbon Dioxide Removal and why is it important?",
    "answer3": "Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is a process where CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from the atmosphere and stored for thousands of years. Humanity is currently on a trajectory to overshoot the target of 1.5°C global temperature increase. To bring the earth system back into a stable, liveable state, we need to remove excess CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere.</br></br> <strong>How does this work?</strong> </br> With our CDR projects, excess biowaste is transformed into biochar. Biochar is a kind of charcoal that is very stable. After production the biochar is applied to the soil, where it improves its quality and the carbon is stored for millennia. This gives it a triple advantage: smallholder farmers gain extra income while their soils improve and become more resilient to climate change.",
    "question4":"How is my donation spent?",
    "answer4": "Your donation is used to fund Carbon Removal projects from the Carboneers. To remove and store 1000 kg (= 1 ton) of CO<sub>2</sub> costs €150. So every Euro removes 6.67 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. If you donate via a postcard, €5 is used for printing and postage costs, the remainder is used for carbon removal.",   
    "question5":"Can I trust these carbon removal projects?",
    "answer5": "Of course. Cycling 4 Climate is a for impact foundation run by volunteers, and trust is our 'raison d'être'. We've been working with the Carboneers as carbon removal partner for two years. They have already removed over 50,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> and have the ambition to remove 1 megaton by 2028. More info on the Carboneers can be found on <a href='https://www.carboneers.earth/' target='_blank'>www.carboneers.earth</a>. Once a participant has finished its GGR, she/he gets a certificate from the carbon removal registry of Carbon Standards International.", 
    "question6":"What do I need to ride the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer6": "Good physical condition! And the commitment to sink at least 100 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. This means: engaging sufficient people to donate and sink together the 100 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>! On average a EU citizen, emits ± <a href='https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/maps-and-charts/greenhouse-gases-viewer-data-viewers' target='_blank'>7.5 tons</a> of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. The goal of 100 tons is thus comparable with the emissions of 13 EU citizens. It takes €150 to remove one ton of CO<sub>2</sub>, therefore the fundraising target is €15,000 per participant.",
    "question7":"Can I also ride a part of the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer7": "Yes you can. Ideally you pass by at least the Morteratsch, Rhône and Aletsch glaciers, and visit the Mer de Glace near Chamonix.",
    "question8":"What does it cost to ride the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer8": "Registration fee for the GGR is € 25. Therefore you’ll get the GPX-file, the day planning and a personal fundraising page on the website. You’ll also receive the digital print files of the postcards you can send to your supporters and you’ll be included in the list of Glorious Glacier Riders. <br>The Glorious Glacier cycling jersey is optional and can be purchased in the webshop of Cycling 4 Climate (make sure you select the right size).",
    "question9":"What is the impact of climate change on glaciers?",
    "answer9": "Due to climate change, glaciers are retreating.Glaciers rely on consistent snowfall during winter to replenish their ice mass.Climate change has led to warmer temperatures, which reduce the amount of precipitation falling as snow and increase rainfall instead.On the other hand warmer temperatures also shorten the duration of the cold season, while the melting period gets longer and warmer.Last but not least, snow cover increases the albedo (reflectivity) of glaciers, which helps delay melting by reflecting sunlight.A lack of snow exposes darker glacier ice, which absorbs more heat and accelerates melting.<br><br>The University of Innsbruck has made predictions on the speed of retreat.The difference between 1.5°C (Paris Agreement) or 2.7°C (current trajectory) global warming by 2100 is substantial.<br><br>For instance, the Rhône glacier had an estimated volume of 1.24km³ in 2020.Under the 2.7°C scenario it is expected to be mostly gone by 2073.If global warming is limited to 1.5°C,22% of the 2020 volume is expected to remain (17% more compared to 2.7°C).<br><br>The glaciers in the Alps are,due to the low altitudes,especially vulnerable to climate change and much of the volume will disappear by 2100.However the largest populations that depend on glaciers live in Asia,where glaciers in the Himalayas will survive longer.Independent on where you live:<strong>0.1°C avoided saves glaciers and limits impacts!</strong><br><br><video style='width:100%;' autoplay='' loop='' muted='' playsinline='' controls=''><source src='img/RGI60-11.01238_+2.7°C.mp4' type='video/mp4'>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><br><br>Other visualisations that the Glorious Glacier Ride will pass<br><a href='https://goodbye-glaciers.info/glaciers/RGI60-11.03638.html' target='_blank'>Argentière</a><br><a href='https://goodbye-glaciers.info/glaciers/RGI60-11.03662.html' target='_blank'>Grande Motte</a><br><a href='https://goodbye-glaciers.info/glaciers/RGI60-11.03684.html' target='_blank'>Glacier Blanc</a><br>More information can be found at the website of <a href='https://goodbye-glaciers.info/' target='_blank'>goodbye-glaciers.info.</a>",
    "question10":"When will the Glorious Glacier Ride be held?",
    "answer10": "The GGR is an individual ride, so you can ride it whenever you're up to the challenge. The GGR-peloton however, will depart from Munich on Thursday 28th of August. It will have a rest day in Zermatt on September 4th. The finish in Monaco is planned for September 11th.
