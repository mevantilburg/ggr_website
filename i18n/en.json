    "p1": "Glaciers are essential to life on Earth. Billions of people - whether in mountainous regions or larger cities - depend on them for steady freshwater supply and dependable food production. Glaciers are our natural water reservoirs.",
    "p2": "However, glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate due to climate change. This threatens ecosystems, water resources, and human communities. Melting glaciers contribute significantly to sea-level rise, posing risks to coastal communities and causing saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies.",
    "p3": "The less ice there is, the less water there is for human use, whether it's for drinking, hydroelectric generation, or irrigation. To keep our planet livable, we need to protect our glaciers and halt climate change."

    "h2": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "question1":"What is the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer1": "The Glorious Glacier Ride is an individual cycling adventure along the most beautiful but retreating glaciers of the Alps to raise awareness on climate disruption. The total ride is 1,500km and more than 30,000 meters of elevation gain need to be climbed. Participants fundraise carbon removal: they invite friends, family, etc to start removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere via their individual fundraising campaign.",
    "question2":"How can I support?",
    "answer2": "You can make a donation to the rider of your choice. You can choose a postcard that will be sent to you, or a direct donation. The money is used to fund carbon removal projects.",
    "question3":"What is Carbon Dioxide Removal and why is it important?",
    "answer3": "Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is a process where CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from the atmosphere and stored for thousands of years. Humanity is currently on a trajectory to overshoot the target of 1.5°C global temperature increase. To bring the earth system back into a stable, liveable state, we need to remove excess CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere.</br></br> <strong>How does this work?</strong> </br> With our CDR projects, excess biowaste is transformed into biochar. Biochar is a kind of charcoal that is very stable. After production the biochar is applied to the soil, where it improves its quality and the carbon is stored for millennia. This gives it a triple advantage: smallholder farmers gain extra income while their soils improve and become more resilient to climate change.",
    "question4":"How is my donation spent?",
    "answer4": "Your donation is used to fund Carbon Removal projects from the Carboneers. To remove and store 1000 kg (= 1 ton) of CO<sub>2</sub> costs €150. So every Euro removes 6.67 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. If you donate via a postcard, €5 is used for printing and postage costs, the remainder is used for carbon removal.",   
    "question5":"Can I trust these carbon removal projects?",
    "answer5": "Of course. Cycling 4 Climate is a for impact foundation run by volunteers, and trust is our 'raison d'être'. We've been working with the Carboneers as carbon removal partner for two years. They have already removed over 50,000 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> and have the ambition to remove 1 megaton by 2028. More info on the Carboneers can be found on <a href='https://www.carboneers.earth/' target='_blank'>www.carboneers.earth</a>. Once a participant has finished its GGR, she/he gets a certificate from the carbon removal registry of Carbon Standards International.", 
    "question6":"What do I need to ride the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer6": "Good physical condition! And the commitment to sink at least 100 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. This means: engaging sufficient people to donate and sink together the 100 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>! On average a EU citizen, emits ± <a href='https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/maps-and-charts/greenhouse-gases-viewer-data-viewers' target='_blank'>7.5 tons</a> of CO<sub>2</sub> per year. The goal of 100 tons is thus comparable with the emissions of 13 EU citizens. It takes €150 to remove one ton of CO<sub>2</sub>, therefore the fundraising target is €15,000 per participant.",
    "question7":"Can I also ride a part of the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer7": "Yes you can. Ideally you pass by at least the Morteratsch, Rhône and Aletsch glaciers, and visit the Mer de Glace near Chamonix.",
    "question8":"What does it cost to ride the Glorious Glacier Ride?",
    "answer8": "Registration fee for the GGR is € 25. Therefore you’ll get the GPX-file, the day planning and a personal fundraising page on the website. You’ll also receive the digital print files of the postcards you can send to your supporters and you’ll be included in the list of Glorious Glacier Riders. <br>The Glorious Glacier cycling jersey is optional and can be purchased in the webshop of Cycling 4 Climate (make sure you select the right size)."
