      "p2": "However, glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate due to climate change. This threatens ecosystems, water resources, and human communities. Melting glaciers contribute significantly to sea-level rise, posing risks to coastal communities and causing saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies.",
      "p3": "To keep our planet livable, we need to protect our glaciers and halt climate change."
