The first day of the ride is a short one, but it is a start. We are in Munich and ready to go. The weather is good, the team is excited, and we are ready to make a difference.

We have been asked many times if climate change is still questioned. The answer is yes, but we are here to show that it is real and that we can do something about it.

The route today took us through beautiful Bavarian countryside, with rolling hills and picturesque villages. We stopped for lunch in a small town where the mayor welcomed us and expressed support for our mission.

Our first mechanical issue happened about halfway through the day - a flat tire on one of the support bikes. It was quickly fixed, and we were back on the road within minutes.

Tomorrow we head towards the foothills of the Alps, where the real climbing begins!
