**Day 9: Mörel-Filet to Nax**

It’s Day 9 on our Glorious Glacier Ride, and the adventure begins long before the first crank of a pedal. At 07:30, the tent was already alive with clattering breakfast prep. Rain drummed on tent canvas, the perfect alarm clock, although no one was thrilled at the prospect of cycling through another day of Swiss drizzle.

Miraculously, by the time the last crumbs of muesli - and last spoon of the plate-wash-up saving dish by Pepijn called “scrambled eggs on porridge” disappeared the rain simply gave up. The gods of cycling smiled on us, and we rolled out under silvery skies—hopes high and rain jackets stashed, for now.

Our wheels hummed along the vast *Rhône valley*, the river our ever-present companion but the wind decidedly less friendly. Fortunately the plains with their 30km/h were soon gone and we instead swung South. We climbed into a new valley, one destined to deliver our Glacier of the Day — legendary Glacier de Moiry and the enigmatic Lac de Moiry. But not before running the gauntlet of Swiss cantonal surprises: The Canton of Valais/Wallis isn’t just famed for cheese and wine—it’s a bilingual Canton too! One minute, German villages greet with “Grüezi,” the next, elegant French signs whispered “Bienvenue.” Road signs and place names changed as abruptly as the weather in the mountains, causing us to wonder where the actual language frontier lied. You haven’t really crossed Switzerland until you’ve cycled through a linguistic border! And of those, Switzerland has many.

Ascending above Sierre, the mood got lighter and the views sharper. Approaching Grimentz—proudly proclaimed “one of the most beautiful villages in the world,” and frankly, they’re not wrong—a treat awaited. Joost Brinkman and Julius Lajtha from the crew all of a sudden bumped into *Tom Schellekens* and *Reis Teunissen van Manen*, Netherlands very own Mountainbike World Championship duo, supposedly training but in reality, barely breaking a sweat as they zipped about, exchanging experiences with us. Recruitment for next year’s GGR may have just begun!

Up, up, and away: another steady climb delivered us to Lac de Moiry, a true fairy-tale sight, especially since its shimmering turquoise waters were boosted by an impressive hydropower dam—very Swiss, very scenic, very… massive. If ever the MI6 needed a new Swiss headquarters, that long, straight, and faintly ominous tunnel leading to Lac de Moiry is a top candidate. Some argued it looked more like a Bond villain’s lair, and both really could have worked.

Lunch was a sun-chased affair—bread, odd spreads, and periodic shivers whenever the sun ducked behind a cloud. Pepijn took on a new role as nutritional taskmaster, urging everyone to “eat whatever you can—just eat, eat, eat, and it’ll still never be enough!” He may have been right: our daily climbs do sapp more calories than it were possible to replenish.

The returning descent from Moiry promised easy rolling—except for Julius, who found himself led astray by a particularly adventurous GPX route. Suddenly, gravel gave way to an ex-MTB trail, only to morph into a skislope dotted with stealthy creeks, errant boulders, and at least one bush evidently hungry for GGR souvenirs, such as the basecap fixed to the back carrier of his bike. Hopefully soon, some resident may pick it up and check the campaign!

Swiss timing and quality planning: in time just before sunset, the whole crew rolled into the campsite in Nax, a ragtag band reunited after a day of headwinds, climbs, sublime glacier views, and hydropower. Pepijn staged a delicious take on Ratatouille, melting away all shivers and strains in record time. No recipe survives a GGR dinner, but nobody goes to bed hungry.

All in all, Day 9 had everything: rain, wind, glacier magic, unexpected encounters with Dutch MTB professionals (soon to be mascots!), tunnels worthy of a secret service movie — and the peculiar joy of seeing Switzerland’s many faces shift before oneself, all from the the same seat: your own saddle. Another day, another summit conquered. Next year, who knows? Maybe Tom and Res will be right there beside us, basecaps firmly attached of course.
