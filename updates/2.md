**The Second Stage of the Glorious Glacier Ride**

Though the Zugspitze -the highest mountain in Germany- no longer hosts a glacier, the sight of it gave us a magical morning. Breakfast was long and strong as it should be. Of course with that amount of plenty we headed out with a half an hour delay and took a last look at the ‘spitz’ as we meandered through small alpine villages. By the time we arrived at the first challenge of the day, the … pass, our legs were warm enough and the few drops of rain weren’t going to stop us either. Sadly the traffic of cars and multiton-trucks roar only a few meters beside us. Both on our way up, but also while we make our descent. Somehow you immediately feel the drivers who have cycled. Giving that little extra space as they manoeuvre to the left, not accelerating as they almost pass you or honking their horn in support instead of a what-the-hell-are-you-doing here.

And then the sun decided to join us for lunch as we stopped literally in the corner of the country ‘Landeck’. Four countries even as only in the afternoon we would be navigating between Germany, Swiss, Austria, Italy and some ‘umleitungen’ due to construction works. Luckily I always like the sense of adventure that comes along with gravel roads, especially if they are accompanied by a fierce mountain river. One more climb of the day and we would be there. The fernpass luckily was more inviting for cyclists. As I counted the corners to the top. In the blink of an eye I saw Natalie and Marcel blasted down again, deciding to do the thing it twice… crazy Swiss.

By then the saltiness of my sweat must have caused a chemical reaction because with the sight of the lake, my tired legs could already smell the hot shower from ten kilometres away at the other side and the rain didn’t even feel wet anymore. Or at least almost. One more peculiar sight of a sunken church tower could’ve kept me thinking about how a world without the glaciers of Greenland or the Antarctic could look like. But then again the water had already risen in the 1950’s as part of the construction of a large hydro dam, meaning the symbolism lies more in progress swallowing tradition. Or how any transition, especially one without the first basic step of reducing excess consumption, cannot go without growth pains. Or perhaps despite of probably a lot of protest when they disclosed the plan in the fifties, is now exactly what makes this place special, and decades later turns out to attract thousands of tourists as an unintended side effect and an economic lifeline for this town. Apparently these thoughts stuck even less than the salty sweat and by the time we had reached our hotel the craving for the hot shower and pizza took over. Only a good night's rest now and on to the Stelvio tomorrow.

**Stage 3 will challenge us with 106km and 3365 meters of climbing, including the famous Stelvio**
