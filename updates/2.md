Today we faced our first serious climbing as we headed into the Alpine foothills. The temperature was perfect for cycling - not too hot, with occasional cloud cover to provide relief from the sun.

We had our first educational stop at a viewing point overlooking what was once a small glacier. A local guide explained how it has receded dramatically over the past 30 years, showing us old photographs that made the loss painfully clear.

The team performed excellently on the climbs, and spirits remain high. We're seeing firsthand how the landscape is changing, which only reinforces the importance of our mission.

No mechanical issues today, though the support team had to replenish our water supplies more frequently than expected on the climbs.

Tomorrow brings our first major mountain pass. We'll need all the energy we can muster!
