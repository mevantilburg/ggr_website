**Stage Four - Livigno to Thusis**

The morning started with fire in Joost’s eyes. On the way to *Diavolezza* he somehow managed to stop a speeding car and almost struck a deal with the driver: offset his ride by removing carbon. For a moment it looked like our mission had found an unexpected ambassador in an Audi – the man even considered it seriously.

Soon after, the real highlight came into view. At the *Morteratsch* cable car we rose towards the ice and suddenly stood face-to-face with our first glacier of the ride. Immense, glowing white, powerful, and fragile at the same time. Joost gave a short speech in the cabin and, as if fortune was on our side, a few passengers instantly connected with our cause. They bought postcards to support carbon removal and shared heartfelt words about the urgency.

Yet the joy was bittersweet. Martin pointed out a painful paradox: right there on top of the glacier, huge airline commercials still promoting flying. A jarring reminder of how disconnected habits and messages can be from the reality beneath our feet.

Back on the saddle we were rewarded with a sweeping downhill, the kind that makes you forget for a moment about burning legs and sore shoulders. But reality returned quickly: *the Albula Pass*. My legs were still raw from the Stelvio, and the climb felt endless. Step by step, corner by corner, I nearly lost my mind. Luckily Simon was there, steady as ever, reminding me that every climb has a summit.

The valley that opened up afterwards was worth it: serene, wide, and beautiful. The descent into Thusis was nothing short of stunning – curves flowing into one another, the kind of road you dream about when you close your eyes at night.

By the time we reached our hotel, fatigue had settled in completely. Another shower, another dinner, another deep breath of alpine air. Tomorrow will bring new challenges, but tonight, only sleep.
